## How It Works

### Real-Time Chat
- When you open a chat, a real-time Firestore listener is set up for that conversation.
- Any new messages sent by either user appear instantly in both users' chat windowsâ€”no refresh needed.
- Messages are stored in Firestore under a `conversations` collection, with a `messages` subcollection for each conversation.

### Study Groups
- **Creation**: Choose a course, set group name and size, invite peers from your course matches
- **Management**: View all your groups, open group chats, leave groups
- **Discovery**: Browse available groups for courses you're taking
- **Real-time Updates**: Group member changes and system messages update instantly

### Group Chat System
- **Automatic Setup**: Firebase conversations are created automatically when groups are formed
- **Member Management**: Real-time updates when people join/leave groups
- **System Messages**: Automatic notifications like "Sarah joined the group" or "John left the group"
- **Persistent History**: All group messages are saved and accessible

### Unread Message Notifications
- **Individual Chats**: Red dot on Messages button shows unread individual messages
- **Group Chats**: Red dot on My Groups button shows unread group messages
- **Smart Updates**: Counts update automatically when opening/closing chats
- **Visual Indicators**: "New Messages" badges on group cards

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Peer_Finding_Network_UCLA
```

### 2. Set up the backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create a .env file with your MongoDB URI and PORT
npm run dev
```

### 3. Set up the frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open your browser
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend test route: [http://localhost:5001/api/test](http://localhost:5001/api/test)

---

## Configuration

### Frontend Environment
- Frontend uses `client/src/config.js` which reads `VITE_API_URL` and falls back to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
- Development (client/.env.local):
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001
  ```
- Production (client/.env.production):
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=<your-prod-backend-url>
  ```
- Rebuild the frontend after changing env: `npm run build` (or restart Vite in dev).

### Firebase Configuration (Optional)
- **System Messages**: Currently logs to console (Firebase Admin needs configuration)
- **To Enable**: Add Firebase service account key to `server/firebaseAdmin.js`
- **Fallback**: System messages appear in server logs when Firebase not configured

---

## Backend Setup - Server

### Required Dependencies
- **MongoDB** - User and group data storage
- **Express.js** - API server and routing
- **Firebase Admin** - Optional, for system messages and group management

### Group Management Endpoints
- `POST /api/groups/create` - Create new study group
